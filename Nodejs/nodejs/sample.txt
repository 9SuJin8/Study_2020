In retrospect, it might seem surprising that something as
mundane as the desire to count sheep was the driving force for
an advance as fundamental as written language. But the desire
for written records has always accompanied economic activity,
since transactions are meaningless unless you can clearly keep
track of who owns what. As such, early human writing is
dominated by wheeling and dealing: a collection of bets, bills,
and contracts. Long before we had the writings of the prophets,
we had the writings of the profits. In fact, many civilizations
never got to the stage of recording and leaving behind the kinds
of great literary works that we often associate with the history
of culture. What survives these ancient societies is, for the
most part, a pile of receipts. If it werenâ€™t for the commercial
enterprises that produced those records, we would know far,
far less about the cultures that they came from.
